# Streaming audience analysis

Analysis of data related to an online streaming platform. In total, there are three separate datasets:
• data_frequency.csv - users have been allocated to separate frequency segments based on their last 13 weeks of activity. 

• data_demographic.csv - age and gender data for users in the sample. 

• data_listening.csv - total seconds, number of distinct programmes and networks streamed in the past 13 weeks for users in the sample. 


The data from all three datasets were merged into one dataset named data_all.csv.

Data cleaning and analysis performed using Python (pandas, seaborn, matpolotlib) with the goalp of gaining a deeper insight into the streaming habits of 
the users. The analysis allowed us to answer questions such as:
• What is the distribution of minutes streamed?

• Which frequency segment streamed the most content?

• Are there any differences in terms of streaming habits between gender and age groups?

• What is the range and average of distinct programmes and networks streamed?

• Is there any correlation between variables such as number of distinct programmes and frequency segment?


Finally, there is a presentation created using jupyter notebook clearly presentation the findings and visualizations.
